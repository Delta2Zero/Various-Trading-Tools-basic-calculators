📊 GCash Investment & Trading Calculators
"Very basic console calculators that automate shit because I suck at math. Written with ChatGPT. Manually tested. Good enough."

💡 What is this?
This is a collection of simple C++ console apps I wrote (with some help from ChatGPT) to automate repetitive calculations related to GCash investment platforms, like:

📈 GStocks (Philippine stock trading)

💵 Gcrypto (crypto market tools)

📉 GTrade / Gotrade (US stocks)

💰 Gbonds – RTBs (Retail Treasury Bonds)

🧾 T-Bills

📊 Dividend calculators

📐 Percentage gain/loss tools

❓Why does this exist?
Because doing the same formulas across 4+ apps every day sucks.

I made these tools to:

Save time

Avoid brain fog doing basic math

Let me focus on actual decisions, not math repetition

🛠 What's inside?
A mix of small, modular C++ tools that:

Run in the console

Prompt for input

Spit out clean, copyable numbers

No GUI. No bullshit. Just fast answers.

🔐 Security / False Flags
If your antivirus or Google Drive flags these EXEs:

That’s on them, not me.
Source code is included — you can inspect, compile, or fork it however you like.

📝 Notes
Not professional software.

Not financial advice.

Just useful math helpers for a guy who doesn't like spreadsheets.

✅ Status
Developed for personal use

Still actively maintained when I feel like it

If it works, I leave it alone
